# Mock Classifier

This repository is used to host the mock Classifier service.

This service is used as a mocked replacement for the real Classifier which is being developed in parallel.

The mock service will facilitate development and demo of other Burokratt components until the real Classifier is available.

This service will respond to a series of known input strings with known output ministries.

The mapping between string and ministry will be hard-coded.
